# P1 Engineering Work Log

## 2026-10-08 — P1.0 Engineering Foundation and P1.1 Canonical Model

### Implemented

- Adapted the existing `GTM_codex` GitHub repository; did not initialize or overwrite a repository.
- Added root project orientation, master architecture boundary, safe `.gitignore`, and non-secret `.env.example`.
- Added P1 README, authoritative state, decision index, work log, and eight ADRs for D001–D008.
- Added a shared logical contract with 23 entities, explicit relationships, supported polymorphic targets, and architecture invariants.
- Added a canonical model narrative and complete Mermaid ERD.
- Added an offline Python validator for model, relationship, history, documentation, decision, ERD, and secret-filename checks.

### Important technical choices

- Used JSON for the machine-readable shared contract so validation requires no external packages.
- Kept source references distinct from canonical entities and allowed unresolved identity state.
- Used explicit effective-dated tables only for attributes and mappings that require as-of history.
- Documented polymorphic references as constrained logical contracts and deferred their physical enforcement pattern.
- Avoided empty P2–P7 or future P1 implementation directories.

### Files created or modified

- Root: `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Shared: `shared/contracts/README.md`, `shared/contracts/canonical-model.v1.json`.
- P1: `README.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `WORK_LOG.md`.
- P1 architecture: canonical model, Mermaid ERD, and ADR-0001 through ADR-0008.
- P1 tooling: `scripts/validate_architecture.py`.

### Verification evidence

Verification was executed after all artifacts were written and is repeated after continuity metadata updates. Observed results:

- `python3 projects/01-data-foundation/scripts/validate_architecture.py` — **passed**: 23 entities, 31 relationships, 8 decisions, ERD coverage, continuity files, and secret-filename checks.
- `python3 -m py_compile projects/01-data-foundation/scripts/validate_architecture.py` — **passed** with no output.
- `python3 -m json.tool shared/contracts/canonical-model.v1.json` — **passed** with exit code 0.
- Custom relative Markdown-link check across repository documentation — **passed**.
- Required-path and forbidden P2–P7 scaffold check — **passed**.
- `npx --yes @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli@11.12.0 ...` — **passed** for SVG and PNG output; rendered PNG was visually inspected. NPM emitted a transitive Puppeteer deprecation warning, but rendering completed with exit code 0.
- `git status --short --ignored` — confirmed local `.env`, `.DS_Store`, and Python bytecode are ignored; no secret file is selected for commit.

### Failures and fixes

No architecture failure occurred. A global `mmdc` binary was unavailable, so the ERD render check used an ephemeral pinned Mermaid CLI through `npx`; no package manifest or generated render was added to the repository.

### Outstanding issues

- This is a logical architecture only; no physical schema or pipeline has been executed.
- Mermaid source receives offline structural validation. Visual rendering depends on an external Mermaid-compatible renderer and is not claimed until executed.
- P1.2 must finalize canonical ID and crosswalk operational rules.

### Git commit

Implementation commit: `33e35c9` (`feat: establish P1 canonical data architecture`). Authored and committed under the repository user's configured Git identity. This log entry is added by a follow-up documentation-only continuity commit to avoid a self-referential hash.

## 2026-10-10 — Repository Cleanup and Documentation Improvement

### Implemented

- Renamed the existing GitHub repository from `BsdSaiPrasad/GTM_codex` to `BsdSaiPrasad/sai-revenueos` without creating a new repository or changing history.
- Updated the repository description and local `origin` URL.
- Reworked the main README as a beginner-friendly landing page with the seven-project map, current progress, repository structure, and reading order.
- Added one central glossary and one continuous beginner walkthrough using synthetic Globex Health, Sarah Kim, John Lee, and related examples.
- Rewrote all eight ADRs with the same approved decisions and a consistent problem → example → options → decision → technical design → reasoning → tradeoffs → interview explanation structure.
- Reorganized the canonical model explanation into five logical learning sections and added an ERD reading guide while preserving all 23 entity names and technical identifiers.
- Simplified the P1 README, master architecture, and decision index while keeping each document focused on one responsibility.
- Updated repository-wide documentation guidelines in `AGENTS.md`.

### Architecture boundaries

- `shared/contracts/canonical-model.v1.json` was not modified.
- `architecture/diagrams/canonical-model.mmd` was not modified.
- D001–D008 retain their original accepted meaning.
- No P1.2 ID, crosswalk lifecycle, matching, or implementation decision was added.
- No P2–P7 functionality or scaffolding was created.

### Verification evidence

Observed results after the complete documentation edit:

- `python3 projects/01-data-foundation/scripts/validate_architecture.py` — **passed**: 23 entities, 31 relationships, 8 decisions, ERD coverage, continuity files, and secret-filename checks.
- `python3 -m json.tool shared/contracts/canonical-model.v1.json` and Python compilation of the validator — **passed**.
- Contract/model consistency script — **passed**: all 23 contract entities appear in the teaching guide, all 31 relationships remain declared, all 8 ADRs remain Accepted with the required sections, and all relative Markdown links resolve.
- Protected-file comparison — **passed**: shared contract, technical ERD, and validator are byte-for-byte unchanged from the prior commit.
- Mermaid CLI 11.12.0 — **passed**: canonical ERD, root overview, and master-architecture diagrams compiled to SVG; the two new overview diagrams also compiled to PNG and were visually inspected.
- Repository-reference and boundary checks — **passed**: no active old GitHub URL, no P1.2/later implementation directory, and no unrelated staged path.
- GitHub and Git remote checks — **passed**: `BsdSaiPrasad/sai-revenueos`, expected description, default branch `main`, new `origin`, and reachable remote `main`.
- Secret checks — **passed**: no tracked `.env`/`.DS_Store`, private-key marker, GitHub token pattern, AWS access-key pattern, or password assignment in staged files.

### Git commit

Pending commit creation. The verified documentation hash will be recorded in a follow-up continuity commit.
