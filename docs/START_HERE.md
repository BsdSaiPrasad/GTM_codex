# Start Here: Follow One Company Through RevenueOS

This walkthrough explains Project 1 through one continuous, synthetic example. Nothing below represents a real customer or production result.

## The Scenario

**Globex Health** appears in both Salesforce and HubSpot. **Sarah Kim** and **John Lee** work there. The company is evaluating a fictional analytics product, signs a contract, and starts a subscription.

The architecture for this journey is complete through P1.1. The ingestion, identity matching, and operational workflows are later work.

## Step 1 — Preserve the Source Records

Salesforce Account `SF-1001` and HubSpot Company `HS-502` are different system records, even when they describe the same company. RevenueOS represents each one as a `SourceRecord`.

**Already designed:** the stable four-part source identity: source system, tenant, object type, and object ID.

**Later:** P1.3 will connect real source systems and store incoming versions. No connector runs today.

## Step 2 — Give the Company a Canonical Account

RevenueOS needs one durable `Account` for Globex Health. Reports and downstream workflows can use that Account even if a source record changes.

**Already designed:** the Account entity is independent of Salesforce and HubSpot identifiers.

**Later:** P1.2 will define how the canonical ID is generated. No final ID format has been approved yet.

## Step 3 — Connect Sources Through the Crosswalk

`ExternalIdentityCrosswalk` connects both source records to the same canonical Account when the match is confirmed.

```text
Salesforce SF-1001 ─┐
                    ├─> Canonical Globex Health Account
HubSpot HS-502 ─────┘
```

The source records are preserved; they are not replaced by the canonical Account.

**Already designed:** mappings are auditable and effective-dated, and unresolved records can remain unresolved.

**Later:** P1.2 will define mapping states, idempotency, correction, merge, and unmerge rules. The matching engine comes even later.

## Step 4 — Connect a Person to the Account

Sarah Kim has one canonical `Person` identity. Her employment at Globex Health is stored separately in `AccountPersonRelationship`.

If Sarah later joins **Northstar Labs**, her Person ID remains the same. One relationship closes and another begins. This preserves her employment history without treating her as a new human.

**Already designed:** Person is durable; employment is effective-dated.

**Later:** matching rules will decide when Salesforce, HubSpot, and product profiles represent the same human.

## Step 5 — Create an Opportunity

Globex Health's potential purchase is an `Opportunity`. It has exactly one primary buying Account: Globex Health.

**Already designed:** Account has zero or many Opportunities; every Opportunity has one primary Account.

**Later:** source ingestion and stage-history transformations will populate and maintain these records.

## Step 6 — Add the Buying Committee

Sarah Kim is the champion and John Lee is the economic buyer. `OpportunityPersonRole` connects each Person to the Opportunity and records their role.

This relationship table is necessary because one Opportunity can involve many Persons, and one Person can participate in many Opportunities.

**Already designed:** the many-to-many business relationship and its effective-dated roles.

**Later:** CRM ingestion and future inference rules will supply the participants and roles.

## Step 7 — Preserve the Commercial Lifecycle

The accepted proposal becomes a `Quote`, then a `Contract`, `Order`, and `Subscription`. Future `Invoice` records represent billing demands.

These are separate entities because a company can sign several contracts, place several orders, or hold several subscriptions. Globex Health remains the same Account throughout.

**Already designed:** the logical commercial entities and their relationships.

**Later:** P5 will implement quote-to-cash workflows. Project 1 only provides the shared identity foundation.

## Step 8 — Keep History Instead of Overwriting It

Suppose Globex Health rebrands to **Helio Health** and changes its primary domain. RevenueOS keeps the same Account ID while adding effective-dated rows to `AccountNameHistory` and `AccountDomainHistory`.

If an identity mapping is wrong, the prior crosswalk row remains in history and a correction supersedes it. The approved architecture does not silently erase evidence.

**Already designed:** selective Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) history and append-oriented corrections.

**Later:** physical database constraints, reconciliation jobs, and stewardship tools will enforce these rules operationally.

## Where to Go Next

1. Use the [glossary](GLOSSARY.md) for unfamiliar terms.
2. Read the [P1 overview](../projects/01-data-foundation/README.md).
3. Explore all entities in the [canonical business model](../projects/01-data-foundation/architecture/CANONICAL_BUSINESS_MODEL.md).
4. Read the [decision index](../projects/01-data-foundation/DECISIONS.md) and its ADRs.
5. Check [project state](../projects/01-data-foundation/PROJECT_STATE.md) before assuming a feature is implemented.
